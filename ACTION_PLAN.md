# Action Plan: Making fluff the "Ruff of Fortran"

## Vision

Transform fluff from its current prototype state (10-15% complete) into a production-ready, blazing-fast Fortran linter and formatter that rivals ruff's impact on Python development.

## Core Principles (from Ruff)

1. **‚ö° Speed**: 10-100x faster than existing tools
2. **üéØ Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box
3. **üîß Fix Everything**: Automatic fixes for all violations
4. **üì¶ Drop-in Replacement**: Compatible with existing workflows
5. **üåê Universal**: Support all Fortran standards + Lazy Fortran

## Critical Path to Success

### Week 1-2: Foundation Emergency Surgery

#### Day 1-3: Test Infrastructure Revival
```fortran
! Current: No tests run
! Target: 100% test execution with coverage
```
- [ ] Add test-drive as dependency
- [ ] Convert all 86 test files to test-drive format
- [ ] Create test runner script
- [ ] Add coverage reporting
- [ ] Set up CI to run tests on every commit

#### Day 4-7: fortfront Integration Completion
```fortran
! Current: AST parsed but not traversable
! Target: Full AST manipulation capability
```
- [ ] Implement `ast_traverse` using fortfront's visitor pattern
- [ ] Implement `ast_get_node_type` with full node type detection
- [ ] Implement `ast_get_children` for AST navigation
- [ ] Implement `ast_get_node_location` for precise error reporting
- [ ] Create comprehensive AST utility functions

#### Day 8-10: Configuration System
```fortran
! Current: TOML parsing stubbed
! Target: Full configuration with defaults
```
- [ ] Integrate TOML-Fortran library
- [ ] Implement configuration loading
- [ ] Add configuration validation
- [ ] Create default configurations for common use cases
- [ ] Support pyproject.toml style configuration

### Week 3-4: Core Linting Engine

#### Implement High-Value Rules First
Priority order based on user impact:

1. **F001**: implicit none (‚úÖ already done)
2. **F006**: unused variables
3. **F007**: undefined variables  
4. **F008**: missing intent
5. **F002**: indentation consistency
6. **F003**: line length
7. **F012**: naming conventions

Implementation template for each rule:
```fortran
subroutine check_rule_fXXX(ctx, node_index, violations)
    ! 1. Use fortfront visitor to traverse AST
    ! 2. Pattern match on node types
    ! 3. Apply semantic analysis from context
    ! 4. Generate violations with fix suggestions
    ! 5. Return actionable diagnostics
end subroutine
```

### Week 5-6: Formatter Implementation

#### AST-Preserving Formatter
```fortran
! Use fortfront's emit_fortran with custom formatting
```
- [ ] Implement style-guide based formatting
- [ ] Preserve comments and preprocessor directives
- [ ] Support partial formatting (ranges)
- [ ] Add format-on-save capability
- [ ] Ensure idempotent formatting

### Week 7-8: Performance Optimization

#### Target Metrics
- **Speed**: Process 100K lines in <1 second
- **Memory**: <100MB for typical projects
- **Startup**: <50ms cold start

#### Optimization Strategies
1. **Parallel Processing**: Use OpenMP for file-level parallelism
2. **Caching**: Implement persistent AST cache
3. **Incremental Analysis**: Only reanalyze changed files
4. **Memory Pool**: Reuse allocations
5. **Profile-Guided Optimization**: Use real-world codebases

### Week 9-10: Developer Experience

#### LSP Server
- [ ] Implement full LSP protocol
- [ ] Real-time diagnostics
- [ ] Code actions for fixes
- [ ] Hover information
- [ ] Go to definition

#### IDE Integration
- [ ] VS Code extension
- [ ] Neovim plugin
- [ ] Emacs package
- [ ] Sublime Text package

### Week 11-12: Ecosystem Integration

#### Build System Support
- [ ] CMake integration
- [ ] Meson support
- [ ] Make integration
- [ ] fpm native support

#### CI/CD Integration
- [ ] GitHub Actions
- [ ] GitLab CI
- [ ] Jenkins plugin
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks

### Week 13-14: Advanced Features

#### Performance Rules (P001-P007)
- [ ] Loop optimization detection
- [ ] Array access patterns
- [ ] Memory allocation patterns
- [ ] Vectorization opportunities
- [ ] Cache-friendly code detection

#### Lazy Fortran Support
- [ ] Seamless dialect detection
- [ ] Automatic conversion
- [ ] Mixed-dialect projects

### Week 15-16: Production Readiness

#### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Test on major Fortran projects (stdlib, LAPACK, PETSc)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks vs competitors
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] Documentation completion

#### Release Engineering
- [ ] Binary releases for all platforms
- [ ] Package managers (brew, apt, conda)
- [ ] Docker images
- [ ] Automated release pipeline

## Success Metrics

### Performance (Must Match Ruff)
| Metric | Current | Target | Ruff Equivalent |
|--------|---------|--------|-----------------|
| 100K lines processing | N/A | <1s | <0.5s |
| Startup time | N/A | <50ms | <20ms |
| Memory usage | N/A | <100MB | <50MB |
| Incremental analysis | None | <100ms | <50ms |

### Feature Parity Checklist
- [ ] 50+ built-in rules
- [ ] Automatic fixing for 90% of violations
- [ ] Configuration compatibility with existing tools
- [ ] Watch mode with instant feedback
- [ ] Editor integration for top 5 editors
- [ ] CI/CD integration for top 5 platforms

### Adoption Goals
- [ ] 1,000 GitHub stars in 6 months
- [ ] 10+ major projects using fluff

- [ ] Package manager availability

## Implementation Priority Matrix

| Impact ‚Üì Effort ‚Üí | Low | Medium | High |
|-------------------|-----|--------|------|
| **High** | Fix tests<br>AST integration | Core rules<br>Formatter | Performance opt |
| **Medium** | Config system<br>TOML parsing | LSP server<br>Watch mode | IDE plugins |
| **Low** | Documentation | Advanced rules | Extensibility |

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **fortfront API gaps**: ‚úÖ Already resolved - APIs available
2. **Performance bottlenecks**: Profile early and often
3. **Memory usage**: Use arena allocators like fortfront

### Adoption Risks
1. **Legacy code compatibility**: Support Fortran 77 onwards
2. **Build system variety**: Support all major systems
3. **Change resistance**: Provide migration guides

## Competitive Analysis

### Current Fortran Linters
- **fprettify**: Slow, limited rules
- **FORD**: Documentation only
- **flint**: Abandoned

### fluff Advantages
1. **Speed**: 100x faster through AST caching
2. **Completeness**: Linting + formatting + LSP
3. **Modern**: Supports latest Fortran standards
4. **Unique**: Lazy Fortran support

## Call to Action

### Immediate Next Steps (This Week)
1. Fix test infrastructure - **BLOCKER**
2. Complete fortfront AST integration - **BLOCKER**
3. Implement first 5 AST-based rules
4. Remove all stub implementations
5. Create benchmark suite

### Community Engagement
1. Blog post: "Building the Ruff of Fortran"
2. Conference talk proposal for FortranCon
3. Reddit/HN launch when MVP ready
4. YouTube demo videos

## Conclusion

fluff can become the "ruff of Fortran" in 16 weeks with focused execution. The path is clear:
1. Fix foundations (Weeks 1-2)
2. Build core features (Weeks 3-8)
3. Optimize performance (Weeks 9-10)
4. Polish UX (Weeks 11-14)
5. Launch (Weeks 15-16)

The Fortran community desperately needs modern tooling. fluff can fill this gap by delivering ruff-level performance and usability to scientific computing.
