# Code Quality Improvements

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Memory Management in String Utils Module
**Issue**: Potential memory leaks in string array resize operations
**Fix**: 
- Added proper deallocation of string components before resizing
- Implemented explicit memory cleanup in all allocation/deallocation paths
- Used proper allocate statements with character length specification

### 2. Input Validation
**Issue**: Missing validation for empty or invalid inputs
**Fixes**:
- Added validation for empty file paths in `get_dependencies()`
- Added validation for empty module names in `get_files_depending_on()`
- Added bounds checking for array indices
- Added minimum size constraints for array initialization

### 3. Array Bounds Safety
**Issue**: Potential out-of-bounds access in array operations
**Fixes**:
- Added bounds checking in `string_array_get_item()`
- Added proper validation of index ranges in cache lookups
- Used `min()` to prevent reading beyond array bounds
- Ensured count never exceeds actual array size

### 4. Resource Cleanup
**Issue**: Incomplete cleanup of allocated resources
**Fixes**:
- Implemented proper cleanup in `string_array_cleanup()`
- Added deallocation of all string components before deallocating arrays
- Ensured temporary arrays are properly cleaned up

### 5. Growth Strategy Optimization
**Issue**: Inefficient memory growth factor
**Fix**: Changed from 2x growth to 1.5x growth factor for better memory utilization

### 6. Edge Case Handling
**Issues**: Unhandled edge cases for empty arrays and zero sizes
**Fixes**:
- Return empty arrays (size 0) instead of single-element arrays with empty string
- Ensure minimum size of 1 for array initialization
- Handle unallocated arrays gracefully in all operations

### 7. Defensive Programming
**Improvements**:
- Added checks for allocated state before accessing array components
- Added validation of string length before trimming
- Protected against negative or zero sizes in resize operations

## Performance Impact
- Minimal overhead from additional validation checks
- Better memory utilization with 1.5x growth factor
- Reduced memory fragmentation with proper cleanup

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with empty inputs and edge cases
2. Verify no memory leaks with valgrind or similar tools
3. Test with very large arrays to verify growth strategy
4. Test concurrent access patterns for thread safety

## Future Improvements
1. Consider implementing a memory pool for string allocations
2. Add configurable growth factors
3. Implement lazy deallocation for better performance
4. Add thread safety mechanisms if needed
