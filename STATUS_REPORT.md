# fluff Comprehensive Status Report

## Executive Summary

fluff is in an **early prototype stage** with significant gaps between claimed completion and actual implementation. While the project has excellent structure and documentation, **most core functionality is stubbed or blocked**, awaiting proper fortfront AST API integration.

## Reality Check: BACKLOG.md vs Actual Implementation

### Phase 1: Foundation ❌ PARTIALLY COMPLETE
- ✅ Project structure and module organization exists
- ✅ Basic fortfront integration (parsing works)
- ❌ **AST traversal not implemented** (TODO in fluff_ast.f90:89)
- ❌ **TOML configuration parsing not implemented** (TODO in fluff_config.f90:100,111)
- ❌ **Path normalization not implemented** (TODO in fluff_common.f90:185)

### Phase 2: Linting Engine ❌ MOSTLY INCOMPLETE
- ✅ Rule registry framework exists
- ❌ **21 of 22 rules are complete stubs** returning empty violations
- ❌ Only F001 (implicit none) has text-based fallback implementation
- ❌ All rules blocked by fortfront AST API issues #11-14

### Phase 3: Code Formatting ❌ INCOMPLETE
- ✅ Formatter structure exists
- ❌ **Format file not implemented** (TODO in fluff_formatter.f90:70)
- ❌ **Range formatting not implemented** (TODO in fluff_formatter.f90:130)
- ❌ Multiple `error stop "AST parsing required - no fallbacks!"` throughout

### Phase 4: Developer Experience ❌ MOSTLY STUBS
- ✅ LSP server structure exists
- ❌ **LSP operations are placeholder demos** with hardcoded URIs
- ❌ **File watching has placeholder implementation**
- ❌ **Diagnostic sorting not implemented** (TODO in fluff_diagnostics.f90:293)
- ❌ **SARIF format not implemented** (TODO in fluff_diagnostics.f90:322)

### Phase 5: Advanced Features ❌ INCOMPLETE
- ❌ **Dependency analysis**: 25+ test functions return `success = .false.`
- ❌ **Dead code detection**: Contains `error stop` statements, tests not implemented
- ❌ **Performance analysis**: Not started

## Critical Findings

### 1. Test Infrastructure Problem
- **86 test files exist but none use test-drive**
- `fpm test` reports "No tests to run"
- Tests are standalone programs that don't integrate with fpm's test runner
- No actual test coverage measurement possible

### 2. Fortfront Integration Gaps
```fortran
! Critical unimplemented functions in fluff_ast.f90:
- ast_traverse (line 89)
- ast_get_node_type (line 100) 
- ast_get_children (line 111)
- ast_get_node_location (line 127)
```

### 3. Rule Implementation Status
| Category | Total | Implemented | Stubbed |
|----------|-------|-------------|---------|
| Style (F001-F015) | 15 | 1 (F001 text-based) | 14 |
| Performance (P001-P007) | 7 | 0 | 7 |
| Correctness (C001) | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| **TOTAL** | **23** | **1** | **22** |

### 4. Blocking Issues
All rule implementations reference: 
> "BLOCKED: Requires fortfront AST API (issues #11-14)"

### 5. Error Stop Locations
Files containing `error stop "AST parsing required - no fallbacks!"`:
- fluff_dead_code_detection.f90 (lines 125, 136)
- fluff_formatter.f90 (lines 109, 215, 224, 393, 420)
- fluff_lsp_server.f90 (line 299)

## fortfront API Status

The good news: **fortfront now has all requested features available**:
- ✅ Complete AST API with arena-based storage
- ✅ Semantic analysis with type inference
- ✅ Visitor pattern support
- ✅ Node traversal methods
- ✅ Type checking and scope management

**However, fluff is not using these APIs yet!**

## Path to Becoming "The Ruff of Fortran"

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix Test Infrastructure**
   - Convert tests to use test-drive
   - Enable actual test execution with `fpm test`
   - Add coverage measurement

2. **Complete fortfront Integration**
   - Implement ast_traverse using fortfront's traverse_depth
   - Implement ast_get_node_type using fortfront's node introspection
   - Implement ast_get_children using fortfront's get_children
   - Implement ast_get_node_location using fortfront's location info

3. **Implement Core Rules Using AST**
   - Remove text-based fallbacks
   - Use fortfront's semantic_context_t for type-aware analysis
   - Implement visitor pattern for rule checking

4. **Fix Configuration System**
   - Implement TOML parsing
   - Complete configuration validation

### Realistic Timeline

Given current state:
- **2-3 weeks**: Fix test infrastructure and fortfront integration
- **3-4 weeks**: Implement all 23 rules using AST
- **2-3 weeks**: Complete formatter implementation
- **2-3 weeks**: Fix LSP server functionality
- **2-3 weeks**: Performance optimization and polish

**Total: 12-16 weeks to production-ready state**

## Recommendations

1. **Stop claiming phases are complete** - Update BACKLOG.md to reflect reality
2. **Focus on fortfront integration first** - This unblocks everything else
3. **Fix test infrastructure immediately** - Cannot measure progress without tests
4. **Implement rules incrementally** - Start with simplest (F002-F005 style rules)
5. **Remove placeholder code** - Better to fail clearly than pretend to work

## Conclusion

fluff has excellent architecture and documentation but is **fundamentally incomplete**. The claimed "✅ COMPLETED" status for Phases 1-4 is **misleading**. The project is approximately **10-15% complete** in terms of actual working functionality.

The path forward is clear: properly integrate fortfront's now-complete AST API and implement the stubbed functionality. With focused effort, fluff could become production-ready in 3-4 months.
