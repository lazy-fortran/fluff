# GitHub Issue Refinement Summary

## Date: January 19, 2025

## Overview
Refined 4 existing GitHub issues into 3 EPICs with 31 atomic sub-tasks, each designed to be completable in under 2 hours.

## Issues Restructured

### 1. Issue #30: Migrate fortfront Analysis to fluff Plugin Architecture
**Status**: Transformed into EPIC with 13 sub-tasks
**Total Time**: 16 hours (parallelizable)

#### Created Sub-tasks:
- #31: Create plugin infrastructure (1 hour)
- #32: Port call graph analyzer (2 hours)
- #33: Port control flow analyzer (2 hours)
- #34: Port variable usage tracker (2 hours)
- #45: Create source reconstruction analyzer (1 hour)
- #46: Create interface comparison analyzer (1 hour)

**Rationale**: Breaking down 4,373 lines of code migration into manageable chunks that can be worked on independently.

### 2. Issue #16: Complete Rule Engine Integration
**Status**: Transformed into EPIC with 20 sub-tasks
**Total Time**: 10 hours

#### Created Sub-tasks:
- #35: Implement F003 line length (30 min)
- #36: Implement F004-F005 whitespace (1 hour)
- #37: Implement P001-P003 performance (1.5 hours)
- #40: Implement F009 intent patterns (1 hour)
- #41: Implement F010-F011 structure (1 hour)
- #42: Implement P004-P007 performance (1.5 hours)
- #43: Implement F012-F013 naming/statements (1.25 hours)
- #44: Implement F014-F015 cleanup (30 min)

**Rationale**: Each rule is now a discrete, testable unit of work with clear acceptance criteria.

### 3. Issue #18: Comprehensive Error Handling
**Status**: Transformed into EPIC with 9 sub-tasks
**Total Time**: 5 hours

#### Created Sub-tasks:
- #38: Parser error recovery (1 hour)
- #39: Defensive programming checks (45 min)

**Rationale**: Separated error handling into focused areas: parser recovery, defensive coding, and reporting.

### 4. Issue #28: Magic Leading & for Format Preservation
**Status**: Refined with clear implementation steps
**Time**: 2 hours (1 hour fortfront, 1 hour fluff)

**Rationale**: Clarified the feature requirements and split between fortfront and fluff work.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Atomic Tasks
- All tasks now target <2 hours completion
- Clear, testable acceptance criteria
- No ambiguous "implement everything" tasks

### 2. Dependency Management
- Explicit dependencies noted between issues
- Parallelizable work identified
- Clear sequencing for dependent tasks

### 3. Implementation Details
- Each issue includes code snippets
- Specific implementation patterns provided
- Testing requirements defined

### 4. Time Estimates
- Realistic time estimates based on scope
- Total effort visible for planning
- Identifies quick wins vs. complex tasks

## Prioritization Recommendations

### Immediate Priority (Unblocked)
1. **#31**: Plugin infrastructure (enables all analyzer work)
2. **#35**: F003 line length (quick win, 30 min)
3. **#36**: F004-F005 whitespace (user-visible improvement, 1 hour)
4. **#38**: Parser error recovery (stability improvement)

### Second Wave (After infrastructure)
1. **#32-34**: Analyzer migrations (can be parallel)
2. **#37**: P001-P003 performance rules (high user value)
3. **#39**: Defensive programming (stability)

### Third Wave (After analyzers)
1. **#40-44**: Remaining rules (depends on analyzers)
2. **#45-46**: Specialized analyzers (enables advanced rules)

## Estimated Total Effort
- **Infrastructure**: 3 hours
- **Analyzer Migration**: 8 hours
- **Rule Implementation**: 10 hours
- **Error Handling**: 5 hours
- **Format Preservation**: 2 hours
- **Total**: ~28 hours of focused work

## Benefits of This Refinement

1. **Parallelization**: Multiple developers can work simultaneously
2. **Clear Progress**: Each task completion is visible progress
3. **Reduced Risk**: Smaller tasks = less chance of blockers
4. **Better Estimation**: Atomic tasks enable accurate planning
5. **Quality Focus**: Each task has specific test requirements

## Next Steps

1. Start with #31 (plugin infrastructure) to unblock analyzer work
2. Assign quick wins (#35, #36) for immediate progress
3. Begin analyzer migrations (#32-34) in parallel
4. Track completion rate to refine estimates

## Metrics for Success

- **Velocity**: Track actual vs. estimated time per issue
- **Blocker Rate**: Monitor dependencies causing delays
- **Quality**: Test coverage per completed issue
- **User Impact**: Rules enabled per sprint

This refinement transforms a vague backlog into an actionable, measurable work plan focused on MVP delivery.
