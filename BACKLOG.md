# fluff Development Backlog

## Overview

This document provides a detailed, tactical implementation plan for developing `fluff` to achieve feature parity with ruff for Fortran. Each task follows the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR TDD methodology and works strictly with typed AST from fortfront's semantic analyzer.

**Current Status**: ~25% complete with 4 AST-based rules implemented

## Phase 1: Foundation üîÑ IN PROGRESS

### Summary
- ‚úÖ **Project Infrastructure**: Core module structure, CLI framework, clean architecture  
- ‚úÖ **fortfront Integration**: AST context wrapper with working node traversal functions (PR #4)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Configuration System**: TOML configuration parsing not implemented (TODO stubs remain)

### Completed in PR #4:
- Fixed AST integration functions (ast_get_node_type, ast_get_children, ast_get_node_location)
- Implemented working AST traversal with fortfront API
- Added proper node type constants and exports

## Phase 2: Linting Engine üîÑ IN PROGRESS (25% Complete)

### Summary  
- ‚úÖ **Rule Framework**: Abstract rule interface, central registry system
- üîÑ **Core Fortran Rules**: 4 of 23 rules implemented with AST
  - ‚úÖ F001: implicit none (text-based fallback)
  - ‚úÖ F002: indentation consistency (PR #4)
  - ‚úÖ F006: unused variables (PR #4) 
  - ‚úÖ F007: undefined variables (PR #4)
  - ‚úÖ F008: missing intent (PR #4)
  - ‚è∏Ô∏è F003-F005, F009-F015: Awaiting implementation
  - ‚è∏Ô∏è P001-P007: Performance rules awaiting implementation
- ‚úÖ **Diagnostic System**: Rich diagnostics with multiple output formats, fix suggestions

### Recently Implemented (PR #4):
- F002: Checks 4-space indentation consistency using AST structure
- F006: Detects unused variables through AST traversal and usage tracking
- F007: Identifies undefined variables with duplicate violation filtering  
- F008: Validates procedure arguments have intent declarations

## Phase 3: Code Formatting ‚è∏Ô∏è MOSTLY STUBBED

### Summary
- üèóÔ∏è **AST-Based Formatter**: Framework exists but core functions contain `error stop` blocks
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Style Guide Integration**: Not implemented
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Format Quality**: Not implemented

## Phase 4: Developer Experience ‚è∏Ô∏è MOSTLY STUBBED  

### Summary
- üèóÔ∏è **LSP Server**: Structure exists but operations are placeholder demos
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Watch Mode and Caching**: File watching has segfault workarounds with FIXME comments
- ‚úÖ **Output Formats and Integration**: Basic diagnostic output formats working

## Phase 5: Advanced Features ‚è∏Ô∏è NOT STARTED

### Epic 5.1: Advanced Static Analysis ‚è∏Ô∏è DEFERRED
#### Summary
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Dependency Analysis**: Has compiler segfault workarounds (FIXME comments)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Dead Code Detection**: Contains `error stop` blocks preventing execution
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Analysis Accuracy**: Not implemented

### Epic 5.2: Performance Analysis ‚è∏Ô∏è NOT STARTED
#### Current Status: Awaiting basic linting completion
- **Next Task**: Complete remaining 18 linting rules first
- **Dependencies**: Working AST traversal (‚úÖ completed in PR #4)
- **Implementation Priority**: Low - blocked by core functionality gaps

### Epic 5.3: Extensibility and Customization ‚è∏Ô∏è NOT STARTED  
#### Status: Deferred pending core completion

## Next Priorities

### Immediate (Next 2-4 weeks):
1. **Complete Core Rules**: Implement remaining 18 rules (F003-F005, F009-F015, P001-P007, C001)
2. **Fix Configuration**: Implement TOML parsing and validation
3. **Fix Formatter**: Remove `error stop` blocks and implement core formatting
4. **Fix Runtime Issues**: Resolve fortfront type system segfaults

### Medium Term (1-2 months):
1. **LSP Server**: Replace placeholder demos with real functionality  
2. **File Watching**: Remove segfault workarounds and implement proper monitoring
3. **Advanced Rules**: Performance analysis and code quality rules

### Long Term (3-6 months):
1. **Advanced Features**: Dependency analysis, dead code detection
2. **Ecosystem Integration**: IDE plugins, CI/CD integration
3. **Performance Optimization**: Match ruff's speed benchmarks

## Current Technical Debt

### Critical Issues:
- Runtime segfaults in fortfront type system preventing testing
- Multiple `error stop` blocks in formatter preventing use
- TOML configuration parsing completely stubbed
- File watcher has segfault workarounds with FIXME comments

### Quality Issues:
- 18 of 23 rules are complete stubs (78% stubbed)
- Test infrastructure fixed but many tests don't run properly
- Misleading completion claims in documentation (now corrected)

## Success Metrics (Realistic)

**Current**: ~25% complete  
**Target for production**: 80% complete

### Milestones:
- **50% Complete**: All 23 core rules implemented and tested
- **70% Complete**: Formatter working, configuration loading, LSP basic functionality
- **80% Complete**: All core features working, performance optimization begun
- **90% Complete**: Advanced features, ecosystem integration
- **100% Complete**: Full ruff feature parity for Fortran
- **Plugin System**: Custom rules and formatters with dynamic loading
- **Rule Development Kit**: Template generator, testing framework, documentation tools
- **Extensibility Polish**: Comprehensive development guide and certification process

## Implementation Status Summary
