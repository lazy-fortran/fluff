# fluff Development Backlog

## Overview

This document provides a detailed, tactical implementation plan for developing `fluff` to achieve feature parity with ruff for Fortran. Each task follows the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR TDD methodology and works strictly with typed AST from fortfront's semantic analyzer.

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: This document has been updated to reflect actual implementation status as of comprehensive reassessment.**

## Current Status: Early Prototype (10-15% Complete)

### Critical Issues to Address
1. **Test Infrastructure Broken**: No tests run with `fpm test`
2. **fortfront Integration Incomplete**: AST traversal/inspection not implemented
3. **22 of 23 Rules are Stubs**: Only F001 has text-based implementation
4. **Core Functionality Missing**: Configuration, formatting, LSP mostly stubbed

## Phase 0: Critical Fixes üö® URGENT

### Task 0.1: Fix Test Infrastructure
- [ ] Convert all 86 test files to use test-drive
- [ ] Enable `fpm test` to actually run tests
- [ ] Add test-drive dependency to fpm.toml
- [ ] Verify tests execute and report results

### Task 0.2: Complete fortfront AST Integration
- [ ] Implement ast_traverse using fortfront's traverse_depth
- [ ] Implement ast_get_node_type using fortfront's node introspection
- [ ] Implement ast_get_children using fortfront's get_children  
- [ ] Implement ast_get_node_location using fortfront's location info
- [ ] Remove all "AST parsing required - no fallbacks!" error stops

### Task 0.3: Fix Configuration System
- [ ] Implement TOML parsing in fluff_config.f90
- [ ] Complete path normalization in fluff_common.f90
- [ ] Validate configuration loading works end-to-end

- [ ] Task 2.4: Implement P001-P007 (performance rules) using AST
- [ ] Task 2.5: Implement C001 (correctness rule) using AST
- [ ] Task 2.6: Add fix suggestions for each rule
- [ ] Task 2.7: Performance optimize rule execution

## Phase 3: Code Formatting ‚ùå NOT STARTED (Structure Only)

### Summary
- ‚úÖ Formatter module structure exists
- ‚ùå **No actual formatting implementation**
- ‚ùå **Multiple error stops for AST requirements**

### Required Tasks
- [ ] Task 3.1: Implement format_file functionality
- [ ] Task 3.2: Implement range-based formatting
- [ ] Task 3.3: Integrate style guides with formatter
- [ ] Task 3.4: Add format validation
- [ ] Task 3.5: Implement format fixes

## Phase 4: Developer Experience ‚ùå MOSTLY STUBS (10% Complete)

### Summary
- ‚úÖ Module structures exist
- ‚ùå **LSP server uses hardcoded demo responses**
- ‚ùå **File watching is placeholder**
- ‚ùå **Output formats incomplete (no SARIF)**

### Required Tasks
- [ ] Task 4.1: Implement real LSP message handling
- [ ] Task 4.2: Complete file watching system
- [ ] Task 4.3: Implement SARIF output format
- [ ] Task 4.4: Fix diagnostic sorting
- [ ] Task 4.5: Add incremental analysis
- [ ] Task 4.6: Implement caching properly

## Phase 5: Advanced Features ‚ùå NOT STARTED

### Epic 5.1: Advanced Static Analysis
- ‚ùå Dependency analysis has 25+ unimplemented test functions
- ‚ùå Dead code detection contains error stops
- ‚ùå No working implementation

### Epic 5.2: Performance Analysis
- ‚ùå Not started

### Epic 5.3: Extensibility
- ‚ùå Not started

## Truth Table: Claimed vs Reality

| Component | Claimed Status | Actual Status | Gap |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|-----|
| Foundation | ‚úÖ COMPLETED | üîÑ 40% Complete | 60% |
| Linting Engine | ‚úÖ COMPLETED | üîÑ 5% Complete | 95% |
| Code Formatting | ‚úÖ COMPLETED | ‚ùå 0% Complete | 100% |
| Developer Experience | ‚úÖ COMPLETED | üîÑ 10% Complete | 90% |
| Advanced Features | üîÑ IN PROGRESS | ‚ùå 0% Complete | 100% |

## Next Immediate Actions

1. **TODAY**: Fix test infrastructure - make tests runnable
2. **THIS WEEK**: Complete fortfront AST integration
3. **NEXT WEEK**: Implement first 5 rules using AST
4. **ONGOING**: Remove all stub implementations

## Notes

- Previous completion claims were aspirational, not factual
- fortfront now has all needed APIs - integration is the blocker
- With focused effort, production-ready in 3-4 months is achievable
- Priority is fixing foundations before adding features
